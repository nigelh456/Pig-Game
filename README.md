Players roll a dice in rounds. A player can roll the dice as many times as they like; each roll is added to the player's round score.
A player can choose to hold their round score, which is then added to their total score. The winning score can be selected, or will be set to 100 by default.
Rolling 1 on the dice means that the player's round score is lost and it's the next player's turn. Rolling a 6 twice in a row will reset the player's total score.
